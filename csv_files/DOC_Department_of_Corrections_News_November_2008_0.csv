"Election Results   Make History  The United States presidential      election held earlier this month was inarguably one of the most            remarkable political events in recent history. The campaign generated  incredible interest and active         participation that transcended eligible voters.  Electing former Illinois   Senator Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States of America carried with it many histori-cal milestones:  ◊ Fist time in U.S. history that an African American was elected President ◊ President-elect Obama is the first president born outside the      continental United States (Honolulu, Hawaii) ◊ First time two sitting senators ran against each other ◊ First time an African-American was  presidential nominee for a major party ◊ Joe Biden became the longest serving Senator in history to become Vice President-elect ◊ November 4, 2008 marked the end of the longest           presidential campaign     season in U.S. history -- 21 months."
