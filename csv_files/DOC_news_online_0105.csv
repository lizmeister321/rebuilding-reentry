"DOC DEPUTY DIRECTOR IS FINALIST FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS CAFRITZ AWARD     Patricia Britton, DC Department of Corrections Deputy Director, was selected as a finalist for the 2004 Morris & Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation Awards for Distinguished DC Government Employees.  Her outstanding contributions were publicly acknowledged during a program and celebration reception on December 17 at The Cafritz Foundation Conference Center on the George Washington University Campus.    This annual DC public service awards program is made possible by a grant from the Morris & Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation and is administered by The George Washington University Center for Excellence in Public Leadership.  Ms. Britton’s nomination for this award was based on her numerous outstanding achievements and her sustained exemplary performance. She spearheaded an overtime taskforce that reduced overtime by 40%; was instrumental in securing a $158,000 federal grant for security enhancements; coordinated the agency’s Smoke-Free initiative; and spearheaded an initiative with the U.S. Superior Court Marshal’s Service for DOC to assume all Superior Court inmate transports resulting in a $1.2 million contract award.   Deputy Director Britton was among a select group of 16 individuals chosen for the award because their performance and dedication exemplifies the best in public service. The Cafritz Award winners and finalists for 2004 were selected from 186 applicants who were nominated from a District of Columbia government workforce of more than 32,000 eligible employees.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the first day on the job in July 1999 I have been humbled by your dedication and determination to do so much with so little.  Over the last five years this agency has overcome so much, succeeded against what sometimes appeared to be insurmountable odds, and risen to each and every challenge.  While withstanding harsh criticism from both friend and foe, we have closed an entire prison system, transferred over 10,000 inmates to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, overcome budget deficits, survived major staff reductions, endured homicides and shooting at the Jail, and terminated some of the longest court-oversight-of-corrections cases in the country.  Each and every day I have carried my DOC badge with honor and pride.  I believe in what it stands for.  I know the importance and necessity of what we do.  What we have shared, accomplished and endured has prepared me well for my next assignment.  I thank you for that.  I look forward to the continued success for the D.C. Department of Corrections that I know will come from your continued efforts.   Thank you again, and keep up the good work.","","","",""

"AN INTERVIEW WITH TERRY KIDWELL: TAKING CORRECTIONS FROM SOUTHEAST TO THE MIDDLE EAST    Terry Kidwell, a recent DOC retiree, is serving as a corrections consultant in Iraq.  On a recent visit home, he stopped by DOC to visit former colleagues.  Mr. Kidwell began his DOC career as a correctional officer in 1983 at the former Maximum Security Facility in Lorton, Virginia.  During 20 years with the agency he worked in the Training Academy, was promoted to sergeant, worked at Occoquan, and also in the Transport Unit. He served as training coordinator for the Special Weapons and Tactical Team, Emergency Preparedness coordinator, security advisor, and as a correctional program specialist Q.    Iraq?  During wartime? What the heck were you thinking?   A.    I probably wasn’t! ☺ No, seriously, Regina Gilmore e-mailed me the announcement about the project. My first reaction was that Director Washington greets Terry Kidwell and Terry’s wife, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity; a chance to take what I had Debbie, when they visited Grimke headquarters in December. learned over a 20+ year career with the DOC and make a small contribution to a very worthwhile effort.  I also remember reading about our troops who were being stretched thin and felt that this project would relieve them of duties that were not really military functions.  Q.   Who is your employer?  What is your job?  Where are you and your colleagues located? A.  I’m with a subcontractor of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) that has a contract with the Justice department.  I’m the Deputy Director for Audits, Intelligence and Investigations.  Our job is to help the Iraqi corrections officials run a more humane, organized prison system.  I can’t reveal the exact location, but we’re based in Baghdad.   Q.  Tell me about your housing, your typical day, and recreation. A.   We stay in a hotel located in a heavily guarded, very secure compound.  We get up early, dress in our war zone gear, meet our security forces, join our convoy and are transported to our assigned location for the day.  We spend the day with our Iraqi Corrections System counterparts discussing the day-to-day operations of prisons.  We work six days each week, 11 to 12 hours a day.  Recreation consists of simple pleasures like sleeping an hour later, or having time to enjoy a cup of coffee.  Q.   How often are you in touch with your family?  How do you reassure them and keep them calm? A.   I have my cell phone, and access to e-mail, so I’m in touch with my family and friends every day.  My wife is very supportive of what I’m doing, and so are the rest of my family and all our friends.  I always tell them not to watch CNN!  Q.   Are there any similarities between DOC and Iraqi Correctional System? A.   Except for the fact that we both house prisoners, none!  DOC is way beyond anything in Iraq.  Q. Is there anything from your corrections experience that prepared you for going to a war zone?   A.    I had excellent training at DOC.  However there is not any one experience that prepares you for the type of environment I am in now.  But my  DOC days taught me to expect the unexpected and to be flexible.  Those things have served me well Terry shares  a lighthearted moment with  Iraqi children near his compound. since I’ve been in Iraq, because so much of it is unexpected.    Q.   Would you do it again? A.  Well, yes…maybe…probably. I believe it is a worthwhile mission. As a people we all need to stand for freedom, self-determination, for human rights.  We all need to be committed to those things we say we stand for.  Q.  Any message for your former DOC colleagues? A.  Tell them that I miss them.  I learned a lot from each and every one of them.  Their friendship, my memories of the camaraderie, and knowing that I am in their prayers sustain me every day in Baghdad.","","","","","","","","","",""
